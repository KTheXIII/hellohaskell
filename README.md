# Hello Haskell

Simple Hello World project with Haskell with just `ghc`

## Requirements

  - [ghc](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)

## Build and Run

Make `run.sh` into an executable

```
chmod +x run.sh
```

Use `run.sh` to run. The scripts can only take in one source code for compilation and running.

```
./run.sh helloworld.hs
```

You can also pass in arguments after file input.

```
./run.sh helloworld.hs arg1 arg2
```
